# Permutation-importance-for-FCS-and-HDDS
This Table contains the permutation importance of all the variables (LSTM + CNN features + CS variables) processed by the random forest integrated in the type (b) model, for FCS and HDDS. The variables are sorted by decreasing permutation importance. The neural network features are displayed with the following notation: "neural network type": "feature number". Note that the features importance was calculated on the test set containing the 2018 data, some features have zero or slightly negative importance scores, i.e., penalize the model slightly. However, these features may have a significant role on other splits of the data that were used for training, removing these features would improve the performance relative to 2018, but would make the model less generalizable to other years.
